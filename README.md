# 🐍 Snake Game (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

A classic Snake game implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
No external libraries or frameworks — just clean, simple frontend code.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **Arrow Keys** to control the snake:
  - ↑ Up
  - ↓ Down
  - ← Left
  - → Right
- Eat the red squares (food) to grow the snake and increase your score.
- Don’t hit the walls or your own body — or it's Game Over!
- Press **Start Game** to begin, and **Restart** to play again after a game over.
